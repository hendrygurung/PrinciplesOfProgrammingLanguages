#Haskell & Python Sudoku Solver Project
Sudoku Descrption: A Sudoku board is a 9 x 9 grid of cells. In addition to rows and columns there are nine 3 x 3 boxes, as shown to the left. A puzzle initially has some of the cells set to a digit in the range 1:9 (1 through 9). A solution to the puzzle has each digit in 1:9 appear exactly once in each row, column, and box. 

Haskell: This functional program of Sudoku solver, given a description of an initial Sudoku puzzle, determines whether the puzzle has no solutions, exactly one solution, or two or more solutions. Sample Board: yyy.hs Main Program: solver.hs

Python: This program encorporates the use of functional, object-oriented, and imperative programming.  The main program: 1)Read a puzzle from sys.argv[1]. 2)Create a Board bd from the string returned by step 1. 3)Print the puzzle using the Board created in step 2. 4)Call the function solve with the Board constructed in step 2. 5)Print each board in the solution list returned by the previous step. Sample Board: board.txt Main Program: solver.py
